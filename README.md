Bug Fix: Missing Blog Class Handling

Added a check in clipboard_fetch_user_data() to verify if the Blog class exists before using it.
If the Blog class is unavailable (e.g., the Blogs component is not installed), the code logs a warning and gracefully defaults to an empty list of blogs. This prevents crashes in environments without the Blogs component.
Improved Fallback Logic

Ensured that the Clipboard component remains functional even when optional dependencies, like the Blogs component, are missing.
Enhanced Debugging

Added error_log statements to provide useful debugging information when:
Posts or comments contain invalid data.
The Blog class is missing or unavailable.
Updated ossn_com.php

Improved the structure and readability of the file.
Added robust error handling for unexpected situations (e.g., missing GUIDs or invalid objects).
Updated component.xml

Bumped the component version to 2.1 to reflect the latest updates.
Enhanced the description to better communicate the componentâ€™s purpose and functionality.
Retained the MIT license, which allows free use, modification, and distribution with attribution.
